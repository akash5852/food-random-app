<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Ever have those days where you just can't decide on what to eat? This app is made for you. Being a university student who had to cook and decide on what to eat everyday, I needed to come up with a way that would solve that exact problem. I decided to create a full-stack app that generates meal ideas based on meal type. I also wanted it to be customizable, so I added the option to add and delete meals.
